        <h2>My story, in a nutshell</h2>
          <p>it all started with colour. Ever since I was little I was mesmerised by colour and the way it changes, and affects our moods. I decided to study history of art for this reason Then after university I set up a small arts publishing company with some friends, who introduced me to my first Mac: a Classic! with Quark Xpress! The first book I ever laid out was made on that piece of Apple history.
          <p>After I moved to London I started freelancing for design agencies with big clients, until I landed a job with the British Film Institute where I designed film posters and campaigns while directing the design department.</p><p>When I went solo again I decided to start learning web design properly, and fell in love with it. Especially WordPress. Now I mostly design and develop WordPress websites.</p>
          <p>Besides running my design practice, I teach Photoshop, Photoshop for Graphic Design, Lightroom and arge for photographers at a great photography school in London: <a href="http://www.photographycourselondon.com/" target="_blank">Photography Course London.</a>
