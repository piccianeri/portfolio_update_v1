      <h1 class="tag name">Hello, I&rsquo;m Piccia.</h1>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I&rsquo;m a seasoned graphic designer and occasional photographer. I started learning about web design in 2013 and have never stopped since. I love WordPress and the community around it. I love to travel and aspire to be a digital nomad. Web design helps with that!</p>
        <p>I am Italian by birth and nationality. I have spent the last 18 years in London where I saw and learnt more than I thought possible. Now I have moved to Spain where the living is much easier, and it's almost always summertime.</p>
        <p>I am a die-hard believer in imagination and the need to keep it agile. I am always drawing or painting or taking photos or learning how to craft code. </p>
        <p>I sell my photos, illustrations and time lapse videos online on the major stock photography libraries.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I've reached a good level of knowledge of web design and WordPress in the past few years. Now I am ready to become a proper web Ninja in all of the following areas:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>PHP</li>
          <li>WordPress</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My highest aspiration is to be able to work while travelling the world. Besides designing websites, I am planning to produce and sell my own online courses and ebooks on graphic design.</p>
